### unofficial frontend javascript sdk

♻️ shepherd replaces the [shopify-buy sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shopify-buy)  
🐏 shepherd powers [sheep-cart](https://github.com/chase-moskal/sheep-cart#readme) store ui  
🛡️ shepherd is written in typescript  
💖 shepherd is free and open source

### but why not use the official sdk?

the official shopify sdk is poorly maintained. it's missing features, and they're not repsonding to issues or merging good pull requests anymore.

to build [sheep-cart](https://github.com/chase-moskal/sheep-cart#readme), i needed some product properties (like `tags`) which the official sdk didn't expose, so i just decided to make a new sdk that would provide what i needed.
