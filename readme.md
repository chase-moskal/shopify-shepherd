### but why not use the official sdk?

the official shopify sdk is poorly maintained. it's missing features, and they're not repsonding to issues or merging good pull requests anymore.

to build [sheep-cart](https://github.com/chase-moskal/sheep-cart#readme), i needed some product properties (like `tags`) which the official sdk didn't expose, so i just decided to make a new sdk that would provide what i needed.
